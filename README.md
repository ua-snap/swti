## Local development

After cloning this template, run it this way:

```
pipenv install
export FLASK_APP=application.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=True
pipenv run flask run
```

The project is run through Flask and will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).  Setting `FLASK_DEBUG` to `True` will use a local file for source data (bypassing API calls) and enable other debugging tools by default.

Other env vars that can be set:

 * `DASH_LOG_LEVEL` - sets level of logger, default INFO
 * `ACIS_API_URL` - Has sane default (https://data.rcc-acis.org/StnData?)
 * `DASH_CACHE_EXPIRE` - Has sane default (1 day), override if testing cache behavior.

## Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

```
eb init # only needed once!
pipenv run pip freeze > requirements.txt
eb deploy
```

The following env vars must be set:

 * `REQUESTS_PATHNAME_PREFIX` - URL fragment so requests are properly routed.
